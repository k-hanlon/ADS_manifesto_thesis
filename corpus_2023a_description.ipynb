      "110900    Mr  Chris  Bowen Shadow Treasurer Australian  Labor  PartyDear Chris,We have been engaged  by you  to examine  and assess the  Australian Labor Party’s federal election policy costings.The scope of our work was purely confined to an examination of the  costings and the  process by which they have been  prepared  by the Parliamentary Budget Office.All of  the  policy  costings in  Labor’s  Budget  Plan  have  been  submitted  to  the  panel and  have  been  fully assessed and reviewed.In assessing Labor’s  election policy costings, we have had  access to  all costings undertaken  by the Parliamentary Budget Office and  have assessed  all the calculation  methods used  to  cost Labor’s election  policy  commitments.We note that more than  half of the costings have capped  funding and  therefore present a high  degree of certainty. Where assumptions have been  made around  potential behavioural responses, we have relied  upon  the assessments of the Parliamentary Budget Office.To  this  end, we  note  that  these estimates, and medium term projections, are  subject to the  same  degree of uncertainty as that described in Commonwealth Budgets, whether they are  prepared by theParliamentary Budget  Office or the Treasury and  Finance Departments.We are satisfied  that the Parliamentary Budget Office has, in developing  its cost estimates and forecasts, applied  established  Budget standards and  practices.We are of the opinion  that:•The  policy  costing  process  has  been thorough  and  comprehensive•The  assumptions  which  underpin  Parliamentary  Budget  Office  costings are sound•All of  the costings in  Labor’s Budget Plan  are  of a  similar quality as Budget estimates generally, and therefore represent a reasonable basis  for assessing the net financial  impact on the Commonwealth  Budget.Yours  sincerelyProf Robert Officer, AM Dr  Michael Keating, AC  Mr  James  MacKenzieCostings panel biographiesProfessor Officer is one of Australia’s best known financial academics and public administrators. He has played a substantive role in advising governments and regulatory bodies on a range of issues associated with infrastructure assets as well as consulting to public, private and government organisations on a vast range of financial and policy issues. He is Emeritus Professor, University of Melbourne (Professor of Finance at Melbourne Business School from 1986 to 2002). He has held a Chair at Monash (1976-1986), Readership at the University of Queensland (1972-1976) and Visiting Professorships at the Universities of Stanford, Rochester and the Wharton School.He holds degrees in agriculture and agricultural economics from Australian universities and an MBA and PhD from the University of Chicago. An experienced Board member and Chairman, current and former roles include: •Chairman, Acorn Capital •Chairman, Victorian WorkCover Authority •Chairman, Victorian Commission of Audit •Chairman, Victorian Funds Management Corporation •Chairman, National Commission of Audit •Director, Transport Accident Commission of Victoria •Board member, Transurban •Board member, Bank of Melbourne •President and Life Member of the Accounting Association of Australia and New Zealand n Senior Fellow, Securities Institute of Australia. In 2003, Professor Officer was awarded the Centenary Medal for services to the public sector. In 2012, he was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) for service to business and education in the field of financial economic theory; as a leader of public and private sector institutions; as an adviser to government; and as an academic administrator.Dr Michael Keating, ACDr Keating is one of Australia’s most respected former senior public servants and leading economists.
