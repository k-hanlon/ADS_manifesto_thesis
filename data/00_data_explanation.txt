cos_sim_output_08_mpnet.npz
	contains a sparse matrix of cosine similarity values between the sentence embeddings (from mp_full_sts_embeddings.npy)
	so from the english annotated sentences using all-mpnet-base-v2. Only cosine similarity values over 0.8 and under -0.8
	are saved to reduce memory space.


english_annotated_corpus.xlsx
	contains all the quasi-sentences with codes and additional information for english documents in the 
	2023a version of the manifesto corpus

english_annotated_df.csv
	Main working document, contains the combined information on a quasi-sentence level, with main_codes
	and RILE. H and NA sentence were removed.
